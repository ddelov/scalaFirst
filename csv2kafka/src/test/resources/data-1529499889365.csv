It was the same company who sold it to ask for the product to be removed from all the patients. During the removal of the prosthesis a nerve was damaged and not immediately diagnosed either. Cp quantified 55-60% BD and started mediation plus 1 year of temporary damage. Mediation was negative. Our first expert Pirrami confirmed liability and 15% BD and temporary damage at 50% for a year. Cp also alleged patrimonial damage as his role at work was changed in peius. We are waiting for Marruzzo's opinion before reserving. SOI to change from 7 to 5. 22/06/15: Marruzzo confirmed liability and 30% BD of which 15% differential damage caused by malpractice.  The claim is litigated. Also the surgery to fix the lesion was performed  with delay as the doctors diagnosed a disc hernia instead of the lesion and this worsened the situation.  17/09/15  Depuy hip prosthetic cases are treated in a binary way.  Crawford and their lawyer for the manufacturer manage all the Depuy claims they cover the cost of replacement surgery.  they do not deal with liability and damage.   in every such case, it is hoped that the replacement surgery will entirely replace the damage.  If something happens in the surgery then we are only the temporary damage.  However, what happens if there is permanent damage?  Pirami considers nerve damage is permanent but trying to argue it was pre-existing.  However, this is a long shot.  We will have some liability here, but it cannot be right that Depuy has no liability at all as the surgery would not have been necessary had their product not been defective.  BD is 30% of which 15-50 is due to the malpractice.  30% = 135,000 and the differential portion is 100,000.  Need also to take into account the patrimonial damage as he was been impaired in the work place.  We assess this at 70,000.  MPL in this case is 170,000.  Issue is how to apportion this between us and Depuy and also the Este hospital which is where the original prosthetic was inserted and they were negligent in their choice of prosthetic.  There is a further allegation that Este was slow in effecting the recall so this delay of 2 months has increased potential exposure to possible cancer.  Bottom line is how much of the MPL will be apportioned to Este and Depuy?  We reckon they will contribute 15% each so we should be looking at 70% of the MPL only.  The demand is for 327,000 for 28% BD and this sum includes the patrimonial damage.  The patrimonial damage is Euro 54,000 based on 28% BD.  Further there is a claim of Euro 50,000 related to a hernia claim which has no merit.  So, the reality is that the MPL of this claim is 224,000.   This is still based on full 28% BD and we say it's differential only.  According to remida that is around 80,000.  Still need to take into account the contribution from Este and Depuy.   Once the 2 issues put by LG have been answered by the expert AC to recommend reserve accordingly. Probably 170,000. 3.12.15: We are waiting for Moreni before posting the reserve.

Cp also alleged patrimonial damage as his role at work was changed in peius. We are waiting for Marruzzo's opinion before reserving. SOI to change from 7 to 5. 22/06/15: Marruzzo confirmed liability and 30% BD of which 15% differential damage caused by malpractice.  The claim is litigated. Also the surgery to fix the lesion was performed  with delay as the doctors diagnosed a disc hernia instead of the lesion and this worsened the situation.  17/09/15  Depuy hip prosthetic cases are treated in a binary way.  Crawford and their lawyer for the manufacturer manage all the Depuy claims they cover the cost of replacement surgery.  they do not deal with liability and damage.   in every such case, it is hoped that the replacement surgery will entirely replace the damage.  If something happens in the surgery then we are only the temporary damage.  However, what happens if there is permanent damage?  Pirami considers nerve damage is permanent but trying to argue it was pre-existing.  However, this is a long shot.  We will have some liability here, but it cannot be right that Depuy has no liability at all as the surgery would not have been necessary had their product not been defective.  BD is 30% of which 15-50 is due to the malpractice.  30% = 135,000 and the differential portion is 100,000.  Need also to take into account the patrimonial damage as he was been impaired in the work place.  We assess this at 70,000.  MPL in this case is 170,000.  Issue is how to apportion this between us and Depuy and also the Este hospital which is where the original prosthetic was inserted and they were negligent in their choice of prosthetic.  There is a further allegation that Este was slow in effecting the recall so this delay of 2 months has increased potential exposure to possible cancer.  Bottom line is how much of the MPL will be apportioned to Este and Depuy?  We reckon they will contribute 15% each so we should be looking at 70% of the MPL only.  The demand is for 327,000 for 28% BD and this sum includes the patrimonial damage.  The patrimonial damage is Euro 54,000 based on 28% BD.  Further there is a claim of Euro 50,000 related to a hernia claim which has no merit.  So, the reality is that the MPL of this claim is 224,000.   This is still based on full 28% BD and we say it's differential only.  According to remida that is around 80,000.  Still need to take into account the contribution from Este and Depuy.   Once the 2 issues put by LG have been answered by the expert AC to recommend reserve accordingly. Probably 170,000. 3.12.15: We are waiting for Moreni before posting the reserve. Following his opinion we will try to settle the claim together with the Este position as De Puy as accepted an unified transaction.

Our Insured's doctor, at birth, thought it was a case of ictthyosis a dermatological condition where the skin is scaly. After 20 days, when therapy for Ictthyosis was not successful, the Ommen Syndrome was diagnosed and the child was transferred to the paediatric oncology department for a bone marrow transplant, following which the baby died 10 weeks after birth.  Our experts are still considering the position and have not yet delivered their reports.  This is a loss of chance case.  Even if there is breach of duty, which is questionable, it seems there will be a lack of causation and even then a low loss of chance.  MPL 2 parents €200,000 less than the minimum due to loss of chance.  25/11/2014: - Following birth by C Section, he was transferred to the neo natal ICU, red splotches were diagnosed on the body.  Ictiosis - colodium baby.  They thought it was dermatological, but it was far more severe.  Baby returned to hospital with high fever and infection and a form of meningitis was diagnosed.  Gap in time to make correct diagnosis was 40 days.  The baby was scheduled for a bone marrow transplant but there was no time to perform the surgery and the infant died.  Domenici says we are liable because once preparation for dermatological issues were ineffective we should have considered alternative issued.  We should have transferred him.  CTP expert is claiming  €750,000.  In our view, MPL is 320,000 for both parents and some costs.  If our second expert confirms we are liable, we will need to settle the claim.  MPL 350,000. 16-03-15.  Criminal proceeding has been initiated.  The PP expert considers that our insured is liable.  However, there is high probability that there is no causative link between the negligent act and the death and the infection would have arisen in any event so the possible therapy would not have been successful.  The prosecution for death will therefore likely fail.  However, they may start again alleging that the conduct as it was a breach of duty resulted in some damage – just not death.  We will have to see what happens.  Faravelli is writing up the report which will confirm this.  The CTP is interested in doing a deal at Euro 200,000 plus expenses at 230,000.  However, we think this is far too high in the light of the likely findings of the criminal proceedings.  Apparently, the hospital is interested in doing a deal nonetheless.  AC to discuss with them. If they are interested in doing a deal in their SIR that is their prerogative.   22/6/15: Criminal proceeding is going to be dismissed as the CTU was deposited which finds possible omitted diagnosis but no causative link to the death as a proper treatment was only possible if there is no infection and there was one plus need 25 days to make the correct diagnosis.  Nothing could have been done.  Syndrome has mortality rate of 50% and the impact was devastating.  All steps taken were appropriate in attempting to diagnose to issue.

However, it is now litigated and further documents have been produced which both initial experts and a further expert, Carta, have reviewed. 49 year old female with spinal issues. Between 2005-2007 she underwent various surgical procedures. The damage is large as the claimant now confined to a wheelchair and is incontinent.  The problem is a fracture of L4 and L5. Experts are still reviewing the papers.  Both experts state that there was a pre-existing condition, although Carta says that there was no indication that the surgery needed to be performed.

Further the claim is for patrimonial damage, but she the claimant is working at the university of Trentino so this is to be rejected.

Set reserve at 200,000 and set J25 code 6/4/16  Claim has now been reserved on a J25 basis with a reserve of 350,000.  Moreni has not yet been called by the CTU to engage in a dialogue about the claim.  The real issue here is what happens when the CTU finds that the private sports medicine dr is liable, which is likely.  Will the court then apportion claims in a judicially expedient and intellectually lazy way by making the liability joint and several  or whether the court will analyse the pure legal liability of each party on its own merits.  This is the real risk factor in this case.  The advice is that our insured should not have any liability and the court should not apportion any to our insured.","Verona","Public","15","2010-12-22","2011-10-05","287","","GROSS","350000.00","","Waiting for L.T.","Newline","2","APP","787","0","2","A","787","0"

Seems that one hand was not developed.  Defence of the hospital and our expert Aprile, says that there is a limit of what can been seen on the scan.  Statistics say that in 53% of cases this cannot be detected.  We have one report and are waiting for the second. Issue is whether an abortion would have been performed, this followed another scan in another hospital which showed the same (no diagnosis).  We are also on the cusp of whether we are inside or outside the 23 weeks.  No physical exam has been permitted.  We need to get a second opinion from Moreni and Aprile as our first expert De Leo's, report is biased against our insured to protect the other facility of which he is a director.

We may be able to share it with AZ Osp Verona 19/09/2014: Wrongful life case where it's alleged we failed to diagnose the fact that the foetus had no hands. We are liable, but the BD does not seem too bad. The scan was performed on week 22, following a prior scan at another hospital at week 12. Our expert Moreni says that both hospitals are liable, as exams were not properly performed in accordance with the guidelines, but we are more responsible than the other structure as we performed the scan to see if the foetus was properly formed or not. We will lose this case as the abortion could be performed at week 24 and even later if there is an impact on the health of the mother. Damages are moral damage to the parents, and the cost of the prosthetic. This alone is €200,000 so MPL is €400,000.This would be shared with the other facility. 25/11/2014: - We will not be liable for failure to diagnose the cleft pallette.

Twice the criminal defence lawyers agreed to provide information and they didn't.  Finally we appointed our lawyer.  It seems that 2 drs want to put the blame on the 3rd dr.  Criminal proceeding is going better than we thought.  We have no request for indemnification yet.  First CTU in criminal proceedings dismissed liability.  Judge has appointed a second one.  Second report says there is a loss of chance to a better birth because there are also other issues.  Public Prosecutor is likely not going to prosecute.  Baby is 70-80%BD.  Various factors suggested hypoxic event prior to birth, but there is some issue on the failure to react to the CTG.  We think case is defensible.  Impossible to assert PH level at birth as only assessed 1 hour post birth this goes to one of the 4 elements acidosis.  We know you can calculate this even after on hour.  This may show a break in the chain of causation.  MPL was €2.2m originally, but need to take other considerations.  1.5m MPL based on 50% loss of chance 17/09/15 Criminal proceeding is still ongoing.  The second CTU appointed by the PP has discharged the drs involved. The judge must now consider whether to archive the claim or not.  PP has requested this.  We have also appointed Dr Bruno to contact the various Drs's experts to gather information.  All the drs want to be separately represented which is a worry, but all points to there being no liability.  we are waiting for Bruno's report.  The claimant has refused access for an IME.  No request for damages at this time.  Have increased the rejection rate to 70% on the basis of the additional PP expert stating there is no liability. 3/12/15 - PP has confirmed that the criminal case will not proceed and the file should be closed.  The claimant has opposed the request.  there will be a hearing on 22/2/16.  We are monitoring the proceeding as the Drs lawyers' did not accept our request for a joint retainer.  Bruno confirms no liability.  Decision on C section was appropriate as was the timing.  The critical issue is failure to diagnose the PH level in the unbilical cord.  Second issue is that there was an interruption of the CTG of 50 minutes, possibly during the obstetric visit.  He is somewhat concerned that the claim will be for BD 100%.    It appears the loss of chance issue is no longer on the table.  Based on this, MPL is now 2.5m. 6/4/16.  PP has initiated a new criminal CTU.  This new CTU involves experts from both parties participating in the process.  The two experts in this new CTU have found that 53 minutes for the C-Section is higher than the 30 minute gold standard.  however, the experts say that the fact that there was no continuous CTG and the fact that there was a delay is not demonstrative of a better outcome in this case.  There would have been the same outcome.  Accordingly, while there is a breach of duty, there would not have been a different outcome.  On the basis of this outcome the PP has asked the judge to archive the file as there is now no criminal culpability.    Even if the criminal proceeding is archived, the civil claim is going to be problematic for us.  BD is 70%.  MPL is 1.5m.  On the basis of the CTU outcome, we have to reduce the % chance of rejection to 30%.  The real issue for me is why did it take 53 minutes for the C-Section to take place.  The decision to operate was taken timely, but it took 53 minutes to perform it as the anaesthetist was not present.  Does this amount to a breach of duty by the insured?  There are also some delays in the timeline that I am not comfortable with.  needs further investigation.  This claim should be reserved.  July 2016 : Dr Raguza is the only dr left in the criminal proceedings.  There are two issues which remain.  Was the level of acidosis taken immediately after birth or after 15 minutes.  If the former, the 4th criteria is established.  The second issue is whether the delay of 53 minutes caused the loss.  AC has recommended a reserve of Eur 1.8m.  70-80% BD.  MPL is 2.5m.

The second CTU appointed by the PP has discharged the drs involved. The judge must now consider whether to archive the claim or not.  PP has requested this.  We have also appointed Dr Bruno to contact the various Drs's experts to gather information.  All the drs want to be separately represented which is a worry, but all points to there being no liability.  we are waiting for Bruno's report.  The claimant has refused access for an IME.  No request for damages at this time.  Have increased the rejection rate to 70% on the basis of the additional PP expert stating there is no liability. 3/12/15 - PP has confirmed that the criminal case will not proceed and the file should be closed.  The claimant has opposed the request.  there will be a hearing on 22/2/16.  We are monitoring the proceeding as the Drs lawyers' did not accept our request for a joint retainer.  Bruno confirms no liability.  Decision on C section was appropriate as was the timing.  The critical issue is failure to diagnose the PH level in the unbilical cord.  Second issue is that there was an interruption of the CTG of 50 minutes, possibly during the obstetric visit.  He is somewhat concerned that the claim will be for BD 100%.    It appears the loss of chance issue is no longer on the table.  Based on this, MPL is now 2.5m. 6/4/16.  PP has initiated a new criminal CTU.  This new CTU involves experts from both parties participating in the process.  The two experts in this new CTU have found that 53 minutes for the C-Section is higher than the 30 minute gold standard.  however, the experts say that the fact that there was no continuous CTG and the fact that there was a delay is not demonstrative of a better outcome in this case.  There would have been the same outcome.  Accordingly, while there is a breach of duty, there would not have been a different outcome.  On the basis of this outcome the PP has asked the judge to archive the file as there is now no criminal culpability.    Even if the criminal proceeding is archived, the civil claim is going to be problematic for us.  BD is 70%.  MPL is 1.5m.  On the basis of the CTU outcome, we have to reduce the % chance of rejection to 30%.  The real issue for me is why did it take 53 minutes for the C-Section to take place.  The decision to operate was taken timely, but it took 53 minutes to perform it as the anaesthetist was not present.  Does this amount to a breach of duty by the insured?  There are also some delays in the timeline that I am not comfortable with.  needs further investigation.  This claim should be reserved.  July 2016 : Dr Raguza is the only dr left in the criminal proceedings.  There are two issues which remain.  Was the level of acidosis taken immediately after birth or after 15 minutes.  If the former, the 4th criteria is established.  The second issue is whether the delay of 53 minutes caused the loss.  AC has recommended a reserve of Eur 1.8m.  70-80% BD.  MPL is 2.5m.  Current discussions are around th Eur 1m.  We need to move on this claim before the criminal proceeding resumes at the end of the Summer.  Dr Raguza has a personal policy with Allianz  AC to follow up on this.","Piedmont","Public","1","2012-01-19","2012-03-28","69","","GROSS","1800000.00","1193696.00","Payment carried out","Newline","B","C","787","504","B","C","787","504"

It has been agreed that we will investigate the claim.  We have appointed two experts.  Main issue is partial deafness as set out above 30% BD. 3/12/15 - only real issue is possible deafness.  She is competing in gymnastics at a high level at school so only deafness is a possible issue.  MPL really is 200,000 for the deafness.  However, no IME has been performed.  Max exposure is 30% BD for deafness, so could be 350,000 absolute worst case.  % chance remains at 50% as have nothing to work with on liability at this time.  6/4/16.  Dal Maso has reviewed the CTG and thinks there is a delay of 5 hours prior to performing the C section.  The condition clearly worsened as a result of this delay so we will be liable.  No proceedings at present.  No lawyer.  The mother is acting as a litigant in person.  We know the child is active in gymnastics and attends school independently so we are confident on the 30% BD even if no IME has occurred yet.  The prior MPL of 250,000 is accurate for the BD.  However, this does not include moral damage or any future hearing aids. If she becomes represented, these would also be claimed.  There is an issue about whether the deafness was caused by the delay in C section.  As the claim is not litigated and as she is not represented, we will make an offer of 150,000.  As we are liable, we need to set a reserve of Euro 500000 July 2016  Marruzzo was appointed to give an assessment of the extent of BD.  We are awaiting the report.

The first request made in the limitation period was not properly a demand as defined in our policy.  We say that this letter did not stop the limitation period.  Second request which was more appropriate was outside the 10 years limitation period so we say it has passed.  We have some limited information on the pathology.  Deafness bilaterally.  30% BD.  They allege other damages as well so they claim 50% BD.  MPL 800 - 1m. 17/09/15  It appears the claim is not time barred and this has been agreed by LR.  It has been agreed that we will investigate the claim.  We have appointed two experts.  Main issue is partial deafness as set out above 30% BD. 3/12/15 - only real issue is possible deafness.  She is competing in gymnastics at a high level at school so only deafness is a possible issue.  MPL really is 200,000 for the deafness.  However, no IME has been performed.  Max exposure is 30% BD for deafness, so could be 350,000 absolute worst case.  % chance remains at 50% as have nothing to work with on liability at this time.  6/4/16.  Dal Maso has reviewed the CTG and thinks there is a delay of 5 hours prior to performing the C section.  The condition clearly worsened as a result of this delay so we will be liable.  No proceedings at present.  No lawyer.  The mother is acting as a litigant in person.  We know the child is active in gymnastics and attends school independently so we are confident on the 30% BD even if no IME has occurred yet.  The prior MPL of 250,000 is accurate for the BD.  However, this does not include moral damage or any future hearing aids. If she becomes represented, these would also be claimed.  There is an issue about whether the deafness was caused by the delay in C section.  As the claim is not litigated and as she is not represented, we will make an offer of 150,000.  As we are liable, we need to set a reserve of Euro 500000 July 2016  Marruzzo was appointed to give an assessment of the extent of BD.  We are awaiting the report.  If we are liable, the MPL is 200,000.  Deafness is only partial if at all.  I have removed the % chance of rejection as there is likely liability, but for a relatively small amount.  If Marruzzo says BD is 200,000 we will set a reserve at that level. Claim made very near to the limitation period 2003 birth and letter 10 years later.

"44247","847","NP Log & Claim Borderea fields","NP","English","DOL is 2003, case made in 2013 so near to the end of the limitation period.  Some months after birth, child suffered eye issues.  One of our nurses noticed ocular dysphasia usually associated with other things.  Some time later, CTP argues that child was diagnosed for Joubert's syndrome.  Genetic disease.  Can give rise to various very severe handicaps.  Family gave birth to another boy with the same pathology as did not know that Joubert Syndrome is 50% if both parents have these gene.  Bonziglia says delay in diagnosis created risk for other pregnancies. However next two didn't have this issue and then the 4th did.  Bonziglia says we are liable.  Sort of wrongful life claim. Delay for the first baby and wrongful life for the 4th.  Moreni disagrees with Bonziglia on the issue of liability.  Moreni is more favourable to us.  E.g. one doctor says that MRI was ordered and not performed and we don't know why. Documentation is poor but liability is not 100% clear.  Risk at birth is 25% at birth.  Damage resulting from birth has been suffered by the mother.  MPL is 600.000 for the child and 150.000 each for the parents.  Euro 100k patrimonial damage.  500 Eur. per month until the child is 18 YO.  MPL 1.2m. 30% 17/09/15  CTP lawyer agrees that the diagnosis was difficult.   This is not a B claim as it is not a birth claim.  If anything it is a failure to treat claim post birth once the eye condition was diagnosed.  The claim is against our insured that we failed to treat at the 6 month control.  The current IQ of the child is 74.  Allegation is that following diagnosis, there would not have been a sibling in 2013 so it is a form of wrongful life case.  However this makes no sense as the claim is made on behalf of the first child not the second.  However the second child does not feature and may not have the same impairment.  the current status of the first child is that with glasses she will have 8/10 vision (3/10 without) however struggles with downward hills.  Also claims mental retardation albeit that IQ of 74 is not technically mental retardation. The claimant is a staunch and public catholic as well as a local preacher.  he will have been aware in 2010 that the cousin (nephew) had the condition so cannot really claim wrongful life for the second child.  There is nothing that could have been done differently for the first child in terms of treatment and there is no damage to the second child, no claim and also unlikely to be brought anyway so this claim should be rejected.  This claim should be rejected-  The previous calculation was based on wrongful life and that was incorrect.    3/12/15  Change SOI to 5 as the IQ does not show mental retardation.  Bigger issue is eye condition with possible surgery to correct it.  Only real allegation is that the claimant cannot run or otherwise walk on stairs due to balance issue.  They say this comes from the failure to diagnose the Joubert syndrome.  Even if there is a failure of diagnosis, treatement would have been the same.  Claimant has demanded 1m.  This has no basis.  We have offered 50k.  MPL is 1m on the basis that is what has been claimed. 6/4/16  Allegation is that treatement should have commenced earlier.  Also, if Joubert syndrome was known to exist in the brother, there should have been advice not to get pregnant.  This makes it similar to a wrongul life claim i.e. B3.  So it's both a SOI 5 for the child and a B3 for the parents.  The father in this case is a teacher of strict catholic doctrine in a catholic church.  As such, it is hard for him to argue that they woudl have used contraception or performed an abortion.  According to Moreni, we failed to identify the Joubert syndrome in the older sibling and our insured therefore breached its duty to advise the parents of the possibility of future children contracting the condition.  However, the child is actually totally fine at this time.  Possible moral damage claim of possible future deterioration.  CTP lawyer accepts current condition of child is fine.

The hypoxic event took place, according to our experts, in vitro between 28 and 35 weeks.  None of the 4 criteria are present.  Delay was therefore not causative of the loss.  Evidence of lack of growth at week 31 should have resulted in closer monitoring and examination and frequent CTGs.  This did not happen.  Reduction of chance of better outcome with difficulty to quantify what would have been the outcome.  Rossi says liability.  Bruno says no.  Issue here is what would have happened differently had we done what Rossi says i.e. more close monitoring.  Rossi is silent on this.  Also, the mother was a smoker in pregnancy which could have explained the slight reduced growth which was only just below the normal parameter.  At most, if there is liability, there will be a differential damage claim only.  AC is going to “cross” the two opinions and find out from Rossi what she says should have been a different outcome.
